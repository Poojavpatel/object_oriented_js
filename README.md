## Javascript Array Methods - map() filter() reduce() sort()

1. **Filter**   
Filter method accepts a function as an argument that loops through each element in the array   
It does not mutate or change the original array that its called from   
Each time the function is called it returns either true or false   
The filter method returns a NEW array which contains only the elements that returned true   

1. **Map**   
Map method accepts a function as an argument that runs for each element in the array   
It does not mutate or change the original array that its called from   
It returns a NEW array of SAME LENGTH   

1. **Reduce**   
Allows you to build something on every single element of array instead of writing a for loop

1. **Sort**   
In sort we pass in two items..it sorts them by some criteria ..returns 1 or -1
